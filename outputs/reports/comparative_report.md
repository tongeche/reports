## Recommendations
- Shift ~10-15% of spend from Maia TOF (CPV €0.05) toward Remarketing (CPV €0.02, CTR 4.2%) to lean into the most efficient inventory.
- Reuse winning creatives from Portugal TOF (CTR 4.3%) to uplift Maia TOF (CTR 3.0%); prioritize mobile-first variants and short hooks.
- Maintain pacing where views are expanding (Nov 2025 MoM views 4.3% while spend -2.9%). Protect CPV by pausing high-CPV segments inside Maia TOF and reinvesting into Remarketing (best CPV €0.02).
- Add two weekly experiments: (1) headline/copy refresh for TOF, (2) retargeting frequency cap test to sustain CTR without inflating CPV.
